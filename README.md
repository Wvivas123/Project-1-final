# Project-1

# Overview
This project uses API's from Zomato and goole maps to create an app where users can quickly and effectively view wait times, locations and menu's for restuarants in a particular city

# Motivation 
The app provides a solution for individuals who are visiting busy metropolitan areas and desire a live view of wait times to easily determine a location that best fits their schedule and needs. 
If individuals are on the go and need a short wait time, this app lets you quickly figure out which place best suits you without taking multiple trips to different locations. 

# Design
Initial view of the app provides a selection of cities that you can choose from, to which various restaurants appear once selection is made and displays location as well as wait time
